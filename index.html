        <h1>Mara Zago Events ensures you never, ever have those problems nor concerns again.</h1><br><br>
        <a>Small scale business events need careful attention or the investment of significant time and hidden cost is lost:<br>there is poor morale, there is poor follow-through and long-term damage is done.<br><br>
        We specifically do not work on a sales kick-off with 500 attending; they are often very well managed. It’s the small, intimate events and experiences that so easily go wrong because people feel they are small they are easy. Oh no…</a><br><br>
        <h1>Perfect assignments for us might be:</h1><a><br><br>

        <ul>
<li>A meeting with one of your most important clients, especially when there is a fear of losing this client to a competitor</li><br>
<li>A 3-day visit of the CEO and Leadership Team of your company, meeting the most important regional clients, the local Management Team etc. A visit that needs an event for 40 to 50 people that enables the CEO and Leadership Team to meet and greet with everybody and to get the team acquainted with the region – think about background about the countries, a boat trip etc.</li><br>
<li>The (bi-)annual or quarterly strategy meeting with your management team.</li><br>
<li>An event for the talent of the company, people that are needed for the success of this quarter, half year, calendar year, your future – to make these people feel valued and understood. A meeting where they will be fueled with excitement about the future, knowledge (inside, outside) and to make them feel part of the company.</li><br>
<li>Real team building, not just ‘another’ day golfing…</li></ul><br>
          We have been on the other side of the table up to Executive level. We’ve truly experienced the vastly better outcomes when a 3-day Executive Leadership is organized well on all fronts, with not the smallest item, implication or detail overlooked.

Have you attended an Away Day to ‘build the team’ and remind them how vital they are where the coffee and catering has been awful and the AV unreliable? Have you ever hosted a visit for a visiting VIP and been unsure of how to ensure they have a great time in your wonderful city?<br><br><ul>
<li>We enjoy working for and with people; we work for you, not for a brand or a company. You are important. We listen carefully and take responsibility to exceed your personal expectations and those of your team. We help you meet your goals.</li><br>
<li>Working with us will feel as creating an experience; it will never feel as if we are just working towards an activity. We make an almost intangible difference, because we know it’s often the details that make the true difference when creating a flow, the perfect conditions to meet your objectives.</li><br>
